# Frontend Mentor - Recipe page Solution
This is a solution to the [Recipe page challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/recipe-page-KiTsR8QQKm). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects. 

What I developed: [recipe page](https://rachael-gatwiri.github.io/Recipe-page/)

**To do this challenge, you need a basic understanding of HTML and CSS.**

## The challenge

The challenge is to build out this recipe page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.
